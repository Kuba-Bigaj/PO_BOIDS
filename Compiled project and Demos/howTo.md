# How to use this program
## Launch
Make sure you have java installed. Go to the directory with the PoBoids.jar file and the starting conditions file (for example demo.txt). Type:
```
java -jar PoBoids.jar demo.txt
```
and hit enter. After a short while the program will start.
## Starting conditions modification
Follow the template provided in the file configTemplate.txt. Launching with the new conditions requires you to change the filename (*demo.txt* in the example) to the one you chose.
